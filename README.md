<h1>🎬 Six Degrees of Hollywood</h1>

<p>🧠 <strong>Can you guess how many steps separate Emma Watson from Jennifer Lawrence?</strong> </p>

<p>Ever wondered how closely connected your favorite actors are?  This project brings the famous "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game to life, using machine intelligence to find the shortest path between any two hollywood actors.</p>

<h2>🌟 Project Description</h2>

<p>This project uses search algorithms, to navigate through a database of actors and movies to find the shortest connection between any two Hollywood stars.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>Search through a database of actors and movies</li>
<li>Find the shortest connection between any two actors</li>
<li></li>Uses BFS and DFS search algorithms </li>


</ul>


<h2>📁 Files</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>degrees.py</code>: Main script containing the search algorithm</li>
  <li><code>util.py</code>: Utility functions and data structures</li>
  <li><code>small</code>: Directory with a smaller dataset for testing</li>
  <li><code>large</code>: Directory with the full dataset of actors and movies</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔧 Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3.10 or higher</li>
</ul>



<h2>🎬 Usage</h2>

<p>To start connecting Hollywood stars, run:</p>

<pre><code>python degrees.py [directory]</code></pre>

<p>Replace [directory] with either 'small' or 'large' to choose the dataset.</p>
